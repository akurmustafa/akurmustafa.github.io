                <h1>You gotta have steel in the walls</h1>
                <p>Once in a while I got asked questions in the form: "I want to learn programming where should I
                    start?", "I
                    have an exam on topic X, how should I study?", "I have heard a lot about artificial intelligence, I
                    wanna
                    know what is going on, what should I do?", "Hey brother, could you lend me some money?"(Oops, this
                    is not
                    the place for it). Whether getting the right advice or not can make huge changes about the future
                    course of the
                    person asking.
                    I know that it
                    could be
                    the difference between loving something or hating it; passing from the exam or failing on it, etc.
                    I am not here to undermine importance of getting a good advice.
                    However,
                    from what I observe some people ask for advice, do research about learning resources; just to
                    procrastinate
                    the actual job, which is sitting and working. If you can learn a new programming language in 50
                    hours, you
                    shouldn't really spend 50 hours getting for advice how to learn it.
                </p>
                <p>Most people are not content,
                    proud with
                    how they spend their time, and they feel guilty about it. They wanna do something productive,
                    something
                    useful for them. Asking for advice, searching for learning resources gives the best of both worlds:
                    people
                    do not feel guilty about how they spend their time, and they don't do the actual "hard" working. I
                    am not
                    here to criticize people having it. I am fully aware that the digital world around us is designed to
                    make us
                    do impulsive things. They shorten our attention space. It is getting harder and harder to just sit
                    and work
                    and it is really hard to get out of this positive feedback (positive has negative meaning in this
                    context,
                    like medicine:)) mechanism. You can't really expect from someone struggling with money, anxiety
                    about future
                    to do things that pay in the long run as if everthing is alright around them. The point of this
                    writing is
                    to point out this obervation in case reader is not aware and put out as a reminder to myself: "once
                    I had
                    it"(Big breakthrough). As Jerry Seinfeld once said: "... you can put all kinds of furniture in, but
                    you
                    gotta have steel in the walls." similary, you can search through best advice all over, but in the
                    end you
                    should follow the advice. </p>
